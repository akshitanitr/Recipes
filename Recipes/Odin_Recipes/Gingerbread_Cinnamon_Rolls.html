        <li>Mollases</li>
        <li>Yeast</li>
        <li>Kosher Salt</li>

    <h4>Steps to Follow</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine warm milk, molasses, and yeast in a small bowl and stir together until combined. 
            Let sit until foamy, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add sugar, salt, and 4 1/2 cups of the flour to the work bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment.
            Beat on low speed until just combined, about 15 seconds. </li>
        <li>Place dough in a large bowl greased with cooking spray and turn to coat. 
            Cover with a clean kitchen towel. Let rise in a warm draft-free place until dough has doubled in size, 1 hour 30 minutes to 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Spray a 13x 9-inch pan with cooking spray. Lightly punch down dough. 
            On a lightly floured surface, roll dough into an 18x10-inch rectangle.</li>
        <li>Spread 1/2 cup butter over dough for the filling. 
            In a small bowl, stir together brown sugar, molasses, cinnamon, ginger, and cloves until well combined. Sprinkle evenly over butter. </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven, uncovered, until golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. 
            Let cool in the pan on a wire rack for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add cream cheese and 4 tablespoons butter to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment; beat on medium speed until smooth, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
